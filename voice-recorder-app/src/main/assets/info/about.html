<p>This app is designed to teach you a British accent, more precisely Received Pronunciation (RP), sometimes referred to as a BBC accent.</p>
<p>This application uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse your voice and shows you where to focus your practice. The tool also keeps a history of your progress.</p>
<p>Other less sophisticated applications are not able to analyse your voice, they merely ask you to repeat what you hear.</p>
<h4>What if you cannot hear the sounds in an English accent?</h4>
<p>Words can be separated into a set of unique sounds called phonemes. However, some of the sounds in the British accent are not present in other languages. For instance, the Japanese have a combined phoneme for two British phonemeâ€™s /R/ and /L/ (liquid consonant).  This makes it difficult for students to assess their own progress. BBC Accent overcomes this issue by analysing your pronunciations and scores your efforts.</p>
