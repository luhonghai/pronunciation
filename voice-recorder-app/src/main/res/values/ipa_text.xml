        RP for short, is the instantly recognisable accent often described as
        \'typically British\'. It is the standard form of British English pronunciation,
        based on educated speech in southern England, widely accepted as a standard
        elsewhere. It is the accent on which phonemic transcriptions in dictionaries
        are based, and it is widely used for teaching English as a foreign language.
        RP is still often associated with good education and social status.
