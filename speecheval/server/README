===============

The rtmplite package (http://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/) is used as the server side application for our audio recording. 

The main file used is: http://code.google.com/p/rtmplite/source/browse/trunk/rtmp.py

The process is started on the server side by following command:

$python rtmp.py -r [path_to_save_data]/ &

This process can be started anywhere, no need to be under the same folder as the recording client which would probably under the www directory. However, it would be good to set the root path; by default, the data will be stored under the same folder as the rtmp.py script.

Due to fact we need wav instead of flv, the rtmplite is modified to fit to our need.
