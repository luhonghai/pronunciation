<p>This application is a training tool to help with analysis of the English language for the accenteasy pronunciation app.</p>
<p>By recording and uploading the sentences supplied, you will be assisting in the production of a unique application to help non-native English speakers to develop their English language skills to the next level. Having usually already mastered the grammar, they will be able to practise their pronunciation, learn how to make sounds that may not be used in their native language and achieve accurate, clear and effective communication.</p></br>
<p>With the help of your recordings, we will be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) to compare and analyse the pronunciation of British accents.</p>
