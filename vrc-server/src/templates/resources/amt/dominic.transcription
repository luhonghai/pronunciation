I live in the rural areas outside of London
I work as an ear nose and throat specialist known as an otorhinolaryngologist
The Queen of England lives in Buckingham Palace
The Colonel was sent on a special mission to Wales
Penguins live in the south in Antarctica
The sixth person in the line up was the criminal
There was a narrow strip of land connect the two land masses, an isthmus
Can I have a fruit pastille for my sore throat
In me many an enemy anemone enema
There are only a few red squirrels left in the UK
The choir sang beautifully during the concert
Worcestershire sauce is an ingredient of a bloody Mary cocktail
